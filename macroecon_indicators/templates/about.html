    <p>The Macroeconomic Indicators App is a website that provides up-to-date information on various macroeconomic indicators. The data is sourced from the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) and includes important indicators such as gross domestic product (GDP), inflation, unemployment, and trade balances.</p>
    <p>The inception of this webapp involves my desire to access specific macroeconomic data for analysis.<p/>
    <p>The <b>general purpose</b> of this website is to provide a way for individuals and organizations to use the FRED economic data to make informed financial decisions. The data can be used to analyze trends, create models, and make forecasts.</p>
    <p>The Macroeconomic Indicators App allows users to view the latest data on the <a href="/indicators">Indicators</a> page. The data is available in multiple formats, including CSV, Excel, and JSON. Users can download the data in any of these formats for further analysis.</p>
    <p><b>Specific Functionality of Indicators Page:</b> If a user wants to Undo/Redo, navigate to Home, About, or FAQ, a button is provided for each of these pages within the <a href="/indicators">Indicators</a> page. </p>
    <p>Here is an example on how to use the app:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Go to the <a href="/indicators">Indicators</a> page and filter the data for a specific date range or economic indicator.</li>
      <li>Export the data into your preferred format through a download (CSV, Excel, or JSON).</li>
