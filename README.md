# Hello and Welcome!

My name is Jesse Curran and this repository serves as my technical project portfolio.
Please don't be shy! Take a look around, watch a demo, critique my work, or send me a message :)

A bit of background on this project list, I created each project with one goal.
That goal, build with passion. Each project is something I found fun to do.
Some were fun and terrifying, others were just fun.

Thank you for taking a look at my work, I appreciate it!

Take care, 
Jesse
